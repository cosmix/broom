# ðŸ§¹ Broom - System Cleanup Utility

Broom asks you for confirmation whenever it's about to perform a potentially destructive operation. You can choose to include or exclude specific 'cleaners' based on your requirements. At the end of a brooming session you will be presented with a summary of the cleanup operations performed, and their characteristics.

## Usage

```
sudo broom [options]
```

Options:
- `-x`: Comma-separated list of cleanup types to exclude
- `-i`: Comma-separated list of cleanup types to include
- `--all`: Apply all removal types

Example: Execute all cleaners except docker and snap
```
sudo broom -x docker,snap
```

Example: Execute only the cache and kernels cleaner
```
sudo broom -i kernels,cache
```

Note that the `-x` and `-i` options are mutually exclusive. And `-all` is mutually exclusive with all other options.

## Building

To build the executable, use the provided Makefile:

```
make
```

This will create the `broom` executable in the current directory.

To install the executable to `/usr/local/bin/`:

```
sudo make install
```

## Note

**Important:** This program requires root privileges to perform most cleanup operations. Always use with caution and consider backing up important data before running extensive cleanup operations.
